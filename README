Some easy-to-use zotonic plugins for munin. To use, copy to the munin
plugin directory and link them like this:

zotonic_PLUGINTYPE_ZOTONICINSTANCENAME[_ADDITIONALPARAMETERS]

Where PLUGINTYPE is the name of the plugin, currently the following
ones are available:

zotonic_numprocesses       * Show the number of erlang processes
zotonic_vmmemstats         * Various memory usage values of the VM
zotonic_sesscount          * Number of active user sessions for sites

Make sure erl_call is in your path. If it doesn't, try: ln -s
/usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/erl_interface-3.7.6/bin/erl_call /usr/local/bin
(Where /usr/local might be just /usr or something entirely different,
depending on your installation,...)

Add the following lines to your munin-node.conf:
    [zotonic*]
    user zotonic
    env.HOME /home/zotonic

(Replace zotonic with the user your zotonic instance runs as, of
course.  env.HOME must point to the directory where the correct erlang
cookie file resides)
